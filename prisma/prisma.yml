# The secret is used to generate JWTs which allow to authenticate
# against your Prisma service. You can use the `prisma token` command from the CLI
# to generate a JWT based on the secret. When using the `prisma-binding` package,
# you don't need to generate the JWTs manually as the library is doing that for you
# (this is why you're passing it to the `Prisma` constructor).
# Here, the secret is loaded as an environment variable from .env.
